Function Update-AtwsFilter {
  <#
      .SYNOPSIS
      This function parses an Atws filterstring or -array and makes sure it conforms to the format needed by 
      core functions.
      .DESCRIPTION
      All Get- are used to make it possible to generate a correctly formatted QueryXML that does what the user
      expects. To make this easier we use an approximation of the default operators in PowerShell, so that it is
      as easy as possible for new users that are experienced in PowerShell, but not in QueryXML to use the module.
      To make variable expansion possible the function should be dot-sourced from the entity wrapper functions. 
      .INPUTS

      .EXAMPLE
      Update-AtwsFilter -FilterString <String[]>
      Parses an Atws filterstring or -array and makes sure it conforms to the format needed by core functions.
