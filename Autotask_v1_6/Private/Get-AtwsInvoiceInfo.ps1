Function Get-AtwsInvoiceInfo {
  <#
      .SYNOPSIS
      This function collects information about a specific Autotask invoice object and returns a generic
      powershell object with all relevant information as a starting point for import into other systems.
      .DESCRIPTION
      The function accepts an invoice object or an invoice id and makes a special API call to get a 
      complete invoice description, including billingitems. For some types of billingitems additional
      information may be collected. All information is collected and stored in a PSObject which is
      returned.
      .INPUTS
      An Autotask invoice object or an invoice id
      .OUTPUTS
      A custom PSObject with detailed information about an invoice
      .EXAMPLE
      $Invoice | Get-#PrefixInvoiceInfo
      Gets information about invoices passed through the pipeline
      .EXAMPLE
      Get-#PrefixInvoiceInfo -InvoiceID $Invoice.id
      Gets information about invoices based on the ids passed as a parameter
